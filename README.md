# Sigma Fleet — Contracts & Cryptography

On-chain Battleships for the [Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org) blockchain.
You can Play it at https://games.ebiome.cc

Two players each stake ERG, hide three ships on an 8×8 grid, and fire five-shot salvos at
each other. Neither player can see the other's board — and neither can lie about it. Every
shot is answered with a Merkle proof that the contract verifies itself, so the score is
derived on chain rather than reported by a client.

This repository contains **the smart contracts and the cryptography that backs them**. The
game client is not open source; nothing here needs it. Everything below can be read,
compiled and tested on its own.

## Why this is worth reviewing

The interesting problem is that Battleships needs hidden state, and a public ledger has
none. The solution here:

- Before a shot is fired, each player commits to a **Merkle root** of their 64-cell board.
- When shot at, the defender supplies a **Merkle proof per targeted cell**. The contract
  recomputes the root from the proof and compares it to the committed one.
- The leaf's first byte is the answer — `1` hit, `0` miss — and it is bound by the proof.
  **The contract counts the hits itself.** Neither client ever supplies a score.
- To collect, the winner reveals their whole board. The contract checks it hashes to the
  original commitment, is a legal `{5,3,2}` fleet, and that the recorded score matches the
  revealed board.

If any of that is wrong, the funds are wrong. That is what this repository is for.

### Reading order

1. `src/contracts/sigma_fleet.ts` — the battle contract, top to bottom.
2. `src/lib/crypto/merkle.ts` — the proof format the contract expects.
3. `tests/e2e_game_simulation.test.ts` — a full match, played out.

> **`src/contracts/*.ts` are reference copies.** The text that is actually compiled lives in
> `fleet.ts`. The copies exist so the scripts can be read and diffed on their own, and
> `tests/contract_reference.test.ts` fails if the two ever drift apart.

## The battle contract

An 8×8 board is 64 cells; a fleet is one 5-cell carrier, one 3-cell cruiser and one 2-cell
destroyer, so **10 hits sinks a fleet**.

### Box registers

| Register | Type | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `R4` | `Coll[GroupElement]` | `[P1 key, P2 key, protocol key]` |
| `R5` | `Coll[Coll[Byte]]` | `[P1 root, P2 root, P1 board hash, P2 board hash]` |
| `R6` | `Coll[Int]` | `[phase, P1 hits, P2 hits, last sunk code]` |
| `R7` | `Coll[Int]` | Coordinates of the salvo currently in flight |
| `R8` | `Coll[Coll[Byte]]` | `[P1 64-byte shot history, P2 64-byte shot history]` |
| `R9` | `Coll[Int]` | `[expiry height, timeout window in blocks]` |

### Actions

Selected by context variable `0`.

**`0` — Play turn.** Answers the incoming salvo with one Merkle proof per target (context
vars `1`–`5`), then fires back. Enforced: alternating phase; exactly five shots (four on the
final turn, since 64 = 12×5 + 4); strictly ascending coordinates, so a salvo cannot contain
duplicates; append-only shot history with no cell fired twice; hit counts equal to what the
proofs prove; players, commitments and timeout window unchanged; pot and script unchanged;
the turn clock not yet expired; the opponent's new deadline no earlier than `HEIGHT +
timeoutBlocks` (the mover can lengthen the opponent's clock by up to 14 blocks of mempool
slack, never shorten it); and exactly one game box spent in the transaction.

**`1` — Claim / settle.** Reveals the claimant's 102-byte board payload in context var `99`.
Checked: it hashes to the commitment in `R5`; it is a legal fleet — three ships of the right
lengths, straight, in bounds and non-overlapping; the claimant actually has claim rights
(10 hits, or full board coverage); and `honestScore` — the opponent's recorded hits must
equal their true hits against the revealed board, allowing for a salvo still unevaluated in
`R7`. A draw is paid when the opponent also reached 10.

**`2` — Claim timeout.** After `HEIGHT > timeoutHeight`, the player who is *not* the active
one sweeps the pot. If the active player is already the recorded winner (10 hits), the sweep
is deferred by one further timeout window so they can settle through action `1`, which has
no deadline; a winner who genuinely vanishes still forfeits one window later. Exactly one game
box may be spent per transaction.

Anything else is rejected.

### Payouts

A 1% protocol fee is taken on settlement. The winner receives `pot − fee`; a draw splits
`(pot − fee)` evenly. A timeout pays the whole `pot − fee` to the claimant.

## The commitment scheme

`merkle.ts` builds a **6-level Blake2b-256 Merkle tree** over 64 leaves, one per cell.

Each leaf is `blake2b256(cellState ‖ perCellSalt)`, where the per-cell salt is derived from a
32-byte CSPRNG master salt. The salt is what stops an opponent brute-forcing a 64-cell board
from its root, and it means a per-cell proof reveals that cell and nothing else.

A proof is **224 bytes**: a 32-byte leaf preimage followed by six 32-byte siblings. The
contract folds it with `powers = [1,2,4,8,16,32]`, taking the cell index bit by bit to decide
sibling order — identical to `generateMerkleProof`. `tests/merkle.test.ts` checks the two
agree for ship and water cells across the tree.

The settlement payload is 102 bytes: 64 grid bytes, 6 geometry descriptors (start and
direction per ship), and the 32-byte master salt.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npx vitest run                 # 62 tests
npx vitest run tests/merkle.test.ts
```

`vitest` compiles both contracts with `@fleet-sdk/compiler` and reduces real transactions
through `ergo-lib-wasm`, so the tests exercise the deployed scripts rather than a model
of them.

For reference, the current build produces:

```
battleships ErgoTree   3432 bytes
lobby      ErgoTree     549 bytes
battleships tree hash   8e92acff548e5f242726819cf206973db4935f0ccb4930032d57623c5302722e
```

The lobby contract carries that tree hash as a compile-time constant and refuses to open a
match whose output script does not match it — so a lobby can only ever hand its escrow to
this exact contract. (`R8` still records the hash for indexers, but the contract no longer
reads it.) The lobby also enforces: exactly one lobby box per accept transaction; an offer
older than 720 blocks can no longer be accepted; and the host's opening move gets at least
360 blocks (or the lobby's own timeout, whichever is larger) before it can be timed out,
since the host is not notified when a stranger accepts.

### The adversarial tests

These are the ones worth reading. Each builds a transaction that *should* fail and asserts
the contract rejects it:

- playing a turn after the clock expired
- claiming a timeout before it expired
- settling with overlapping ships
- claiming a draw that is not a draw ("tie theft")
- forging a board hash that disagrees with the play-time Merkle root
- an opponent denying hits, resolved by full-board coverage

## Known issues

A full review, with signed proof-of-concept transactions for every finding, is in
`audit/CONTRACT_REVIEW.md`. The single-input guard, score-aware timeout, one-sided deadline
windows, lobby expiry, first-turn grace and hard-coded game hash from that review are applied
in the contracts above. Two things worth knowing before you read the code and find them
yourself:

**The play-time Merkle root is not bound to the settlement board hash.** `R5` carries two
independent commitments per player — the root used during play, and the hash revealed at
settlement — and nothing forces them to describe the same board. Someone can therefore commit
a root that disagrees with their real board.

It is not profitable in expectation, but it is not harmless. The strongest form is a
one-cell lie: the root declares one real ship cell as water, so the opponent's recorded hits
are capped at 9 and they can only win by covering all 64 cells. The cheater then settles with
their real board and collects the whole pot whenever the opponent has not yet fired at the
hidden cell in an answered salvo. Simulation puts that at roughly one match in seven against
a hunt-and-target opponent and it cannot be detected during play; when it fails the cheater
is locked out of both settlement paths and forfeits. See finding 4 of the review, and
`tests/root_board_desync_exploit.test.ts`. The fix is to append the play root to the hashed
payload and compare it in both settlement actions — O(1), but a commitment-format change that
needs a redeploy and a client update, so it is not yet applied.

**Fixed:** `cleanHex32` and `normalizeRootHex` used to strip serialisation prefixes
unconditionally, so a raw 32-byte commitment that merely *began* with one of those byte
patterns was truncated and zero-padded into a different — still well-formed — commitment.
Measured at roughly 1 in 39,000 values, or about 1 in 10,000 matches across the four
commitments a match writes. The affected player could then neither prove a shot nor claim a
win, and forfeited their own stake with no attacker involved. They now strip only when the
input is longer than a bare 32 bytes; `tests/hex_normalisation.test.ts` covers it.

Turn timeouts are currently fixed at 24 hours, and the client caps wagers at 1 ERG. Neither
is a contract limit.
